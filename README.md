# BreastCancer-Classification

Project Overview

This project involves the classification of breast cancer diagnoses using a machine-learning model. The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which contains features computed from breast cancer cell images. Based on these features, the goal is to classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

Project Description
This project aims to build a predictive model to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The project involves:

Data exploration and preprocessing
Feature selection and engineering
Model training and evaluation
Hyperparameter tuning
Results analysis and visualization
Data
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggel.

Data Description
Features: 30 numerical features computed from breast cancer cell images
Target: Diagnosis label (1 for malignant, 0 for benign)

NumPy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
sci-kit-learn


Results
The results of the classification model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, are presented in the Jupyter notebook. The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics and visualizations.
